/*A bank evaluates loan applicants based on the following criteria:
1. Credit Score:
o If the credit score is above 750, the loan is automatically approved.
o If the credit score is between 650 and 750, additional checks are performed.
o If the credit score is below 650, the loan is denied./*

2. Income:
o For credit scores between 650 and 750, the customer’s income must be at least $50,000
for the loan to be considered.

3. Employment Status:
o If the customer’s income is at least 50,000, the system checks whether the customer is
employed.
o If the customer is unemployed, the loan is denied.

4. Debt-to-Income Ratio:
o If the customer is employed, the system checks the debt-to-income (DTI) ratio.
o If the DTI ratio is less than 40%, the loan is approved.
o If the DTI ratio is 40% or greater, the loan is denied.
